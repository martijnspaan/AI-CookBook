description: Best practises
globs: Always use best practices when writing code. The API layer should use union architecture and never use var for variables, always make the type explicit; favor ICollection over IEnumerable; favor records over classes. The frontend web app should also use best practises for Angular apps and responsive design for tablets and mobile.
