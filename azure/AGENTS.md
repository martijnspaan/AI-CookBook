# Azure Infrastructure Guidelines

## üîí Security & Compliance Framework

### Environment Isolation
- **Restricted Scope**: All Azure operations strictly limited to designated sandbox environment
  - **Subscription**: `Playground - masp`
  - **Resource Group**: `MealWeekPlanner`
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with least-privilege principles
- **Network Security**: Configure network security groups and application security groups appropriately

### Data Protection Standards
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enable encryption for all storage services and databases
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key Management**: Utilize Azure Key Vault for secrets and certificate management
- **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backup and disaster recovery procedures

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices

### Resource Management
- **Descriptive Naming**: Follow consistent, descriptive naming conventions for all resources
  - Format: `{environment}-{service}-{purpose}-{region}`
  - Example: `dev-web-app-eastus`, `prod-cosmosdb-cookbook-eastus`
- **Tagging Strategy**: Implement comprehensive tagging for governance and cost management
  - Required tags: Environment, Owner, CostCenter, Application
  - Optional tags: Project, Version, Compliance

### Deployment Automation
- **ARM Templates**: Use Azure Resource Manager templates for infrastructure provisioning
- **Bicep**: Consider Bicep for more readable and maintainable infrastructure code
- **Pipeline Integration**: Integrate infrastructure deployment into CI/CD pipelines
- **Environment Promotion**: Implement proper promotion strategies across environments

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Services & Architecture

### Recommended Service Stack
- **Compute**: Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB for application data, Azure Blob Storage for static assets
- **Networking**: Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door for global distribution
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics

### Scalability & Performance
- **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling rules for compute resources
- **CDN Integration**: Use Azure CDN for global content distribution
- **Caching**: Implement Redis Cache for improved application performance
- **Load Balancing**: Configure appropriate load balancing strategies

### Cost Optimization
- **Resource Sizing**: Right-size resources based on actual usage patterns
- **Reserved Instances**: Utilize reserved instances for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances**: Consider spot instances for non-critical workloads
- **Cost Monitoring**: Implement cost alerts and regular cost reviews

## üîß Operational Excellence

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Application Insights**: Implement comprehensive application monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Configure health check endpoints for all services
- **Alerting**: Set up proactive alerting for critical metrics and failures
- **Logging**: Implement structured logging with proper log levels

### Disaster Recovery
- **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backups with appropriate retention policies
- **Multi-region Deployment**: Consider multi-region deployment for high availability
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document and test disaster recovery procedures
- **RTO/RPO Targets**: Define and implement recovery time and point objectives

### Compliance & Governance
- **Policy Enforcement**: Use Azure Policy to enforce organizational standards
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Implement compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging for all Azure activities
- **Security Center**: Utilize Azure Security Center for security recommendations

## üöÄ Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Implement blue-green deployment patterns for zero-downtime deployments
- Use Azure Traffic Manager for traffic routing and failover
- Implement proper rollback procedures for failed deployments

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Use AKS for container orchestration and management
- **Helm Charts**: Package applications using Helm for easier deployment
- **Service Mesh**: Consider service mesh for microservices communication
- **GitOps**: Implement GitOps workflows for continuous deployment
