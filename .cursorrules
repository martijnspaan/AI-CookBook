# AI Cookbook Cursor Rules

## Automatic Deployment Rule
After completing any piece of work that involves changes to the application code, ALWAYS automatically run the appropriate update.ps1 script command based on which components were modified:

- If changes were made to files in the `API/` directory: Run `.\update.ps1 -Image api`
- If changes were made to files in the `Web/` directory: Run `.\update.ps1 -Image web`  
- If changes were made to both `API/` and `Web/` directories: Run `.\update.ps1 -Image all`
- If no application code changes were made: Do not run the update script

## Testing Protocol
- All testing of the application functionality should be performed on the Kubernetes pods after deployment
- The application runs on localhost k8s cluster with Web on port 4200 and API on port 4201
- Never test locally without deploying to k8s first
- After running update.ps1, verify the deployment completed successfully before proceeding with any testing

## Workflow
1. Complete the coding task
2. Identify which image(s) need updating based on file changes
3. Automatically run the appropriate update.ps1 command
4. Wait for deployment to complete successfully
5. Test the application on the k8s cluster
6. Report results to user

## Exception Handling
- If the update.ps1 script fails, troubleshoot the issue before proceeding
- If deployment fails, check pod status with `kubectl get pods -n ai-cookbook`
- Only proceed with testing after successful deployment confirmation
